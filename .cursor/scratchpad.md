# Complete Farmer Website v5 - GTM Event Tracking

## Background and Motivation

Following the initial setup of Google Tag Manager, the next step is to implement event tracking for key user interactions. The user wants to track clicks on the "Get in touch" button in the navigation bar, and the different options under the "Sign up" button, such as "Create a CF Buyer account". This will provide valuable data on user engagement and conversion paths.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1.  **Locating Components**: The first step is to identify the correct Astro/React components that render the navigation bar and the sign-up buttons.
2.  **Implementing Tracking**: A scalable method for tracking is needed. Adding `data-` attributes to the button elements is a clean way to define GTM events in the HTML.
3.  **GTM Configuration**: The user will need to configure Google Tag Manager to listen for these events. This involves creating custom data variables, a trigger, and a tag. The implementation in the code should make this as straightforward as possible.
4.  **No Generic Click Listener**: The project doesn't seem to have a generic click listener that pushes `data-gtm-*` attributes to the `dataLayer`. It's better to add specific `onClick` handlers for now to avoid side effects.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1.  **Identify and Modify Header Component**: Locate the component responsible for the navigation header and add tracking to the "Get in touch" button.
2.  **Identify and Modify Sign-up Component**: Locate the component that contains the "Sign up" button and its options ("Create a CF Buyer account", etc.) and add tracking attributes.
3.  **Provide GTM Setup Instructions**: Create a clear, step-by-step guide for the user to configure their GTM workspace to capture these events.

## Project Status Board

- [x] **Task 1: Track "Get in touch" button clicks**
    - [x] Locate the `Header.astro` component.
    - [x] Add an `onClick` handler to the "Get in touch" button to push a `gtm.click` event to the `dataLayer`.
- [x] **Task 2: Track "Sign up" option clicks**
    - [x] Locate the `Header.astro` component containing the "Sign up" button options.
    - [x] Add `onClick` handlers to each of the sign-up options to push a `gtm.click` event with details to the `dataLayer`.
- [ ] **Task 3: Provide GTM configuration guide**
    - [ ] Write instructions for creating Data Layer Variables in GTM.
    - [ ] Write instructions for creating a Custom Event trigger.
    - [ ] Write instructions for creating a GA4 Event Tag.
- [ ] **Task 4: Track "Get in touch" button in Products Header**
    - [ ] Locate the `ProductsHeader.tsx` component.
    - [ ] Add an `onClick` handler to the "Get in touch" button to push a `gtm.click` event to the `dataLayer`.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

I have completed the code modifications for tracking the button clicks. I will now provide the instructions for configuring Google Tag Manager.
The GTM configuration instructions have been provided. The task is now complete. Please verify and confirm.
A new task has been added to track the "Get in touch" button in the `ProductsHeader`. Awaiting approval to proceed.
The tracking for the "Get in touch" button in the `ProductsHeader` has been implemented. All tasks are now complete.

## Lessons

*   For custom event tracking with GTM, `data-` attributes combined with a listener or direct `dataLayer.push` calls on `onClick` are effective methods.
