# Project Plan

## Background and Motivation
The user wants to hide the "Powered by" text on the website. This likely refers to a footer or attribution link that is not desired on the live site.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- The "Powered by" text is not directly present in the component files, suggesting it might be dynamically inserted or part of an external library. It was identified to be part of the BambooHR widget.
- The div containing the "Powered by" text is associated with the `#BambooHR-Footer` ID, which can be targeted with CSS.

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] Add a CSS rule to `src/assets/styles/global.css` to hide the `div` with the ID `#BambooHR-Footer`.

## Project Status Board
- [x] Task: Hide the "Powered by" div in `global.css`
  - Status: Completed
  - Success Criteria: The div with ID `BambooHR-Footer` is no longer visible on the page.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
